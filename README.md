Shiny r-code for GEDEM's Data-playground. Available at:http://gedemced.uab.es/en/population-composition

 p("GEDEM's data-playground allows users to explore, visualize and download population data for each municipality 
                                  in Spain (over 8,000 municipalities) since 2000. The database also includes computations of various indices 
                                  of segregation and diversity using the smallest geographical units available (Census Tracts)."),


The app allows user to explore population change, residential segregation, and increasing population diversity in Spanish municipalities (+-8.000) between 2000 and 2015. Users can download and reuse data (as csv or txt files) and plots (as png files). 
The project is part of my PhD in Demography at the Centre d'Estudis Demogr√†fics (CED) and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (2015).
