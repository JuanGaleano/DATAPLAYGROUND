Shiny r-code for GEDEM's Data-playground. 

[**ACCES THE DATAPLAYGROUND**](https://gedemced.shinyapps.io/DP_CATALONIA/)

GEDEM's data-playground allows users to explore, visualize and download population data for each municipality 
                                  in Spain (over 8,000 municipalities) since 2000. The database also includes computations of various indices 
                                  of segregation and diversity using the smallest geographical units available (Census Tracts).
Users can download and reuse data (as csv or txt files) and plots (as png files). 

The project is part of my PhD in Demography at the [Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics (CED)](http://ceu.uab.es) and the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

 GEDEM’s data-playground uses data from the Municipal Registers of inhabitants, which is disseminated by [National Statistics Institute (INE)](http://www.ine.es/). All remaining errors are the responsibility of the authors alone.

GEDEM’s data-playground has been launched as a free online database (Open Access). The idea is that data and results from ongoing 
                                  research can go out and impact policymakers, civil society, academic and media circles
                                  Here is our suggested citation if you use the database: **Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics (2015), *GEDEM Data-playground Version 1.1*.
