# DATAPLAYGROUND
Shiny r-code for GEDEM's Data-playground. Available at:http://gedemced.uab.es/en/population-composition
The app allows user to explore population change, residential segregation, and increasing population diversity in Spanish municipalities (+-8.000) between 2000 and 2015. Users can download and reuse data (as csv or txt files) and plots (as png files). 
The project is part of my PhD in Demography at the Centre d'Estudis Demogr√†fics (CED) and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (2015).
